This project focuses on Hummmingbird processor based devices with USB Download enabled.  The core of this project is the HIBL (Hummingbird Interceptor BootLoader).  The HIBL contains a signed portion of code which authenticates with the Hummingbird processor.  The HIBL also contains instructions to download unsecured code via USB and attaches the new code into the booting sequence.   For most devices, a hardware modification will be required to utilize this booting sequence
